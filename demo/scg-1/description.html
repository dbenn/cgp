Documentation<BR>for the Sisyphus-I<BR>Room Allocation Task</H1>

<P>

We want to compare different approaches

to the modeling of problem-solving processes in knowledge-based

systems and the influences of the models on the knowledge acquisition

activities. To this purpose we give a short description of a sample

problem concerned with office assignment in a research environment.

Research groups who participate in Sisyphus-I are requested

to describe how this problem can be solved and represented in

their approach. To ease comparison and to allow for a well-founded

discussion, we propose a structure for the reports. Please

adhere to it.

<P>

In this second round of Sisyphus-I, we decided to use almost the

same problem statement, that is the office-assignment

task. It has been changed a little bit, by adding a second set

of slightly changed data (see Section 2.5). We assume that this

will give the reader an even better chance to understand the functioning

of your approach. Additionally, this introduces the issue of brittleness.We

would like to know how a model reacts to unusual cases.

<P>

Furthermore, we require <I>traces</I> of the problem-solving processes

of your system for both problem statements. This means  that this

year we want descriptions of <I>operational</I>  problem solvers.



<H2>1. Format of Reports</H2>

<P>

These formatting instructions resulted from the Sisyphus-I discussions

at EKAW91. Please adhere to them. Remember that your Sisyphus-I

article is a contribution to an ongoing discussion, and not a

full scientific paper.

<H2>2. Statement of the Sample Problem</H2>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image1.gif">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Figure 1: The ch&acirc;teau of HNE. YQT resides on

the first floor</B>

<P>

The members of the research group YQT  of the HNE laboratory are

moved to a new floor of their ch&acirc;teau. Due to severe cuts

in funding they only get a very limited number of offices. It

will be quite a problem to cram them all in. To complicate matters

even further some will have to share an office. After several

vain attempts each ending as nightmares that would have impressed

Freddy, the management of HNE is desperate. Sisyphus-I is their

last hope. HNE  implores the Sisyphus-I teams to provide knowledgeable

systems that are up to the task.

<HR>



<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image2.gif">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Figure 2: The part of the floor-plan of the ch&acirc;teau

that we will consider in our sample application</B>

<P>

It is important that the systems' ways to solve the problem follow

the shining example of the wizard Siggi D., the only one who ever

managed to solve the problem. The system developers should be

aware of the fact that YQT's members are used to be pampered.

They all have their personal preferences and professional peculiarities

that should better be observed, as the dungeons of the BABYLON

tower are deep and lonely.

<H3>2.1. Data on People and Offices</H3>

<P>

Not all members of YQT can profit from this new office space in

the ch&acirc;teau, about half of the group stay in their old offices.

<H4>2.1.2. Hierarchical Structures Within YQT:</H4>

<P>

Within the subset of members of YQT we have the following organizational

structure:

<P>

Thomas D. is the head of the group YQT; Eva I. manages YQT; Monika

X. and Ulrike U. are the secretaries; Werner L. and Angi W. work

together in the RESPECT project; Harry B., J&uuml;rgen L. and

Thomas D. work in the EULISP project; Michael M. and Hans W. work

in the Babylon Product project; Hans W. is the head of this large

project, Marc M., Uwe T. and Andy L. pursue individual projects;

Katharina N. and Joachim I. are heads of larger projects that

are not considered in this problem.



<H4>2.1.3. The Offices on YQT's Floor of the Ch&acirc;teau</H4>

<P>

C5-123, C5-122, C5-121, C5-120, C5-119 and C5-117 are large rooms

that can host two researchers. Large rooms can be assigned to

heads of groups too. C5-113, C5-114, C5-115 and C5-116 are single

rooms.

<H3>2.3. Note 1</H3>

<P>

Our wizard Siggi D. seems to pursue a general strategy of assigning

the head of group and the staff personnel first, followed by the

heads of large projects, who through their seniority are eligible

for single offices (some are more equal then others). The offices

of the head of group and the staff should be close to each other.

Heads of projects should, if possible be allocated offices close

to the head of group's. 

<H3>2.4. Note 2</H3>

<P>

Twin offices are assigned to the members of research projects,

under the consideration that synergy among projects is boosted.

This means that researchers that work in same projects are, if

possible not sharing an office. Coworkers that work on related

subjects can share an office. It is important not to put smokers

and non-smokers together into twin offices.



<H3>2.5. A Second Problem Statement</H3>

<P>

The second problem statement reflects a a more recent situation

at HNE. Katharina N. left, and Christian-I joined the group. Christian

I. is just a researcher, he smokes, he works in MLT, and he is

a hacker. He is <I>not </I> a head of project.

<P>

The office situation stays the same. Again, all the members of

the group must be assigned. Obviously, the situation has changed,

and the system must show how it copes with this slightly modified

data-set.

<P>

Remember that this second problem statement has been introduced

to adress the issue of brittleness. We would like to see which

general precautions your model takes, so that it can cope with

borderline cases.
